# Workshop: Bayesian Statistics with JASP 

This repository contains materials for my workshop on Bayesian Statistics with JASP, held at Angelo State University on September 6, 2019

## Materials
- Workshop slides ([pdf](workshop.pdf))
- [JASP software](http://jasp-stats.org)
- Online Bayes factor [calculator](https://tomfaulkenberry.shinyapps.io/anovaBFcalc/) for ANOVA summaries

## Data sets 
Each of the datasets below is formatted in CSV (comma separated value) format, which is the format required for JASP. You will want to download the files somewhere on your computer. Windows users should "right-click" on the CSV link. Mac users should "ctrl+click" on the CSV link. Alternatively, you can download a single ZIP archive of the files [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomfaulkenberry/bayesAngeloState/master/datasets.zip).

*Note*: all datasets below are from the book *Learning Statistics with JASP* by Navarro, Foxcroft, and Faulkenberry, which is freely downloadable at [https://learnstatswithjasp.com].

### Example 1 (independent samples t-test)

Suppose we have 33 students taking Dr Harpo's statistics lectures, and Dr Harpo doesn't grade on a curve. In fact, Dr Harpo's grading is a bit of a mystery, so we don't really know *anything* about what the average grade is for the class as a whole. There are two tutors for the class, Anastasia and Bernadette. There are 15 students in Anastasia's tutorials, and 18 in Bernadette's tutorials. We are interested in whether Anastasia or Bernadette is a better tutor, or if it doesnâ€™t make much of a difference.
